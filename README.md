# Currency Converter

A simple PHP application that converts currencies using exchange rates stored in a CSV file.

## API Endpoints

The application exposes the following API endpoint for currency conversion:

- **POST /api/convert**
  - **Request Body:**
    ```json
    {
      "sourceCurrency": "USD",
      "destinationCurrency": "EUR",
      "sourceAmount": 100.00
    }
    ```
  - **Response:**
    ```json
    {
      "source_currency": "USD",
      "destination_currency": "EUR",
      "source_amount": 100.00,
      "destination_amount": 92.00,
      "exchange_rate": 0.92
    }
    ```

## Sample Request

To convert 100 USD to EUR, send a POST request to `/api/convert` with the following JSON body:

```json
{
  "sourceCurrency": "USD",
  "destinationCurrency": "EUR",
  "sourceAmount": 100.00
}
```

This will return the converted amount and exchange rate in the response.
